If you've won a prize in the Vyper bounty portion of the contest, please head here for more information.\nClaiming Your Prize $100,000 worth of STG will be distributed to winners of the hackathon, based on their final scores on the Telegram leaderboard.\nThe rewards for the Stegos hackathon will be sent out on 23rd December 2019.\nIn the meantime, we'll be sending out a confirmation transaction to every address registered in the hackathon. This will be a 1 STG transaction with a comment telling you your total award. (Since you're already reading this, hopefully you followed the link from that comment!)\nOnce you've received your transaction, please claim your reward by sending a message to Jerry, our Telegram bot. Simply send him the command /claim \u0026lt;your mainnet address\u0026gt; and Jerry will automatically register your claim. On 23rd December, we will automatically send rewards out to everyone who has claimed in this way.\nFor privacy reasons, we recommend you then make a new Stegos account and send yourself the award, to break the link between your Telegram ID and your STG.\nParticipants who were unable to backup and restore their wallet from the hackathon should contact us on Telegram as soon as possible.\nFAQs How many STG were awarded?\nThere was a prize pool of $100,000 in STG. At a price of $0.10 per STG (the most recent STG sale price), that's a massive 1 million STG awarded to participants!\nI restored my wallet from the hackathon but the address has changed!\nThat's perfectly normal. Stegos addresses have a different prefix and final characters depending on the chain being used. The hackathon was held on the testnet, where all addresses begin \u0026ldquo;stt\u0026rdquo;. On the mainnet your address will being \u0026ldquo;stg\u0026rdquo; and have a slightly different ending.\nWhy is my reward lower than my testnet balance?\nAs explained in the rules, final testSTG balances have been converted to STG based on the total number of testSTG awarded during the hackathon.\nWhat is the conversion rate between testSTG and STG?\nOur bounty bot Jerry ended up awarding just over 27 million testSTG, so the conversion rate is approximately 27:1.\n"},{"uri":"/getting_started/installing_wallet/","title":"Tutorial 1: Installing the App","tags":[],"description":"","content":"Install the Stegos desktop wallet by visiting the latest release page:\nhttps://github.com/stegos/stegos-wallet/releases/tag/v1.0\nScroll to the bottom, and click the \u0026ldquo;Assets\u0026rdquo; button to expand the menu.

We had over 30,000 registered entries and tens of thousands of pieces of great content to help spread the word about Stegos and the importance of privacy and the dangers of government surveillance.\nBut let's get to the exciting part: the prizes!\nThis page will explain the current status of the Vyper bounty and answer the most common questions about what happens next, when and how prizes will be distributed, and what to do if you think your points are incorrect. If you want information about the $100,000 hackathon which was running simultaneously, please head here.\nWhen will the winners be announced and prizes distributed? The provisional leaderboard can be found here: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1t_4JZJfz4dcLDlN4qAu2Za2xlbKYxnd9yoCWWYK6vac\nWe've already answered a lot of individual queries, but to make sure everything is completely fair we're going to take a week to address any final concerns about incorrect or missing points, and the leaderboard will be finalized on Wednesday December 18th.\nPrizes will be distributed on December 23rd, at the same time has the hackathon.\nWhy has there been such a long delay? I'd like to apologize that the results are taking so long to process. In my original design for the bounty and hackathon, the points for the social media tasks were going to be handled automatically by Jerry our bounty bot and combined into single score. Unfortunately, I discovered too late that Vyper has extremely limited data export options, so we've had to do everything separately and manually with the help of an external moderation company.\nAll future contests will be run internally, because we can definitely build something better and more private than the commerically available options!\nWhat's the current leaderboard status? Now that the external moderators have finally finished, we believe that the prize tiers are correct for the top 1000 participants. Please note that this is not the same as the points or the rankings being 100% correct, espeically once we get past rank 50: it just means that everyone should be getting the prize they deserve.\nThere are a couple of reasons for this:\nFirstly, for some tasks it was simpler to not award points at all, usually because everyone completed them successfully and so manually adjusting the points would have been impossible.\nSecondly, the moderators did NOT moderate every piece of content submitted: the goal was to finalize the top 1000 places, and once we reached the lower half of the leaderboard we found a lot of bad and plagiarized content, broken links and generally diminishing returns on a process that has already taken far longer than we expected.\nThe scores have changed a lot in the past few days. Is that right? Unfortunately, for a long time there was a bug that we weren't aware of: people who had cheated the referral system and been disqualified were still showing up on the public leaderboard. Vyper has fixed this bug, and now the scores are accurate.\nWhy is my score so low? The short answer is that it's probably correct.\nThe highest content awards, which were much higher than the low- and mid-range points, were reserved for EXTREMELY high quality content. The goal was always to only award a handful of these prizes, so that's why there aren't many people with tens of thousands of content points.\nHow can you be sure the prizes are being assigned correctly? We're 99% sure that everyone is on track for the correct prize, but there is still a small possibility that someone who deserves a prize hasn't been given the correct score. This could happen if you're at the margin of some of the prize thresholds or if you created a particularly good piece of content, but DIDN'T complete all of the tasks (and so didn't make the moderation cut-off).\nIf you believe this applies to you, please contact Brill or Shearry in the Telegram chat and they will look into it.\nWho should get in touch with the Stegos admins? People who are missing a LOT of points (more than 10,000) or people who are missing a small number of points but this would definitely affect their prize level.\nPlease get in touch if you believe you created a piece of content that deserves the highest points in its category and you haven't received any points for it.\nPlease also get in touch if you're very close to one of the tier thresholds and are missing points that would take you up to the next prize category.\nWho should NOT get in touch with the Stegos admins? Basically everyone else. We're a very small team and we've already spent a lot of time moderating the bounty. The vast majority of the points totals are correct, and those that aren't should not affect the outcome of the contest. If you're missing a few hundred points and it's going to take you from position 990 to 930, it's irrelevant as far as the prizes are concerned. I'm sorry we can't create a 100% accurate leaderboard, but we weren't expecting to get so many entries or for Vyper to have so few moderation tools. We don't have the resources to manually moderate the more than 100,000 individual pieces of content submitted to the bounty.\nA warning to cheaters and plagiarists The majority of people entered the bounty in good faith, but some people used fake referals and copied content (both from other participants and from elsewhere on the internet). The external moderators have awarded 0 points for these tasks, but the participants have not been disqualified if the rest of their tasks were done well. HOWEVER, my policy for this final stage of moderation will be more strict: If you contact the admins to try and claim extra points and we find that you have copied your content, you will be disqualified entirely. YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED.\nWhat happens now? We're leaving the moderation open for another week for people to raise any issues. We'll close the moderation and finalize the leaderboard on December 18th. Then we'll randomly select the 40 winners from places 100-1000 and notify the 140 winners.\nWhat do I need to do? If you're 100% sure that there's a RELEVANT point discrepancy, then please raise it to one of the admins in the Telegram chat.\nIf you haven't done so already, download the latest version of the Stegos wallet and restore your wallet from the bounty (or create a new one if you didn't create a wallet before or were unable to back up and restore your wallet.)\n"},{"uri":"/developers/","title":"FOR DEVELOPERS","tags":[],"description":"","content":""},{"uri":"/getting_started/send_transaction/","title":"Tutorial 3: Send a Transaction","tags":[],"description":"","content":"To send a transaction, simply enter the Stegos wallet app and choose \u0026ldquo;Send\u0026rdquo; from the menu on the left-hand side.\nChoose the account you want to send STG from, and then fill in the other fields.\nIf you want to verify this transaction later, make sure you check the \u0026ldquo;Generate Payment Certificate\u0026rdquo; box.

Up to 51.25% of the STG pre-mine may be privately sold to high net-worth individuals and companies to reach a maximum of $30 million. Stegos has already raised $15 million of this target in 2018. Once the mainnet is launched, STG tokens will be sold directly to the general public using the built-in DEX.\n Has development started? Development has been on-going for many months. The testnet launched has already launched, and mainnet is due to launch in Nov 2019.\n When does the mainnet launch? Mainnet will launch in November 2019.\n What features will be available at mainnet launch? Most features will be implemented at launch, although full mobile support will come later. The Stegos desktop app will be available for Windows, MacOS and Linux, but without full messaging support. It will be possible to send messages using the transaction interface, but the chat UI and group chat functionalities will be added later.\n Is there a way to help with testing? Yes! We are currently running a $200,000 joint bounty program and hackathon to test our network and spread the word about Stegos.

In addition to an integrated STG wallet, the app will include many features, including private chat, mobile node setup, red packets (hongbao) and access to the privacy app store.\n Will I be able to stake directly from the app? The Stegos app is designed to be an accessible gateway to the world of crypto and privacy. You will find full and simple in-app instructions for setting up a node so you can start earning tokens from your pocket within minutes.\n Will the Stegos app support private messaging? Yes. Private communication will be integrated within the Stegos app. Messages will be sent as zero-value transactions via the Stegos blockchain and pruned from the chain once the messages are confirmed as read. Users can send a QR code via private chat to initiate an STG transaction. It will also be possible to create chat groups and invite people to chats via QR codes.\n Where can I find other Stegos privacy apps? In addition to the main Stegos app, the Stegos privacy ecosystem is designed to encourage the development of other apps which focus on privacy and use the Stegos platform as a base. To help users find these apps, Stegos will have an on-chain privacy app store.\n How will the app store work? How will I know apps are safe and private? Stegos privacy apps will be stored off-chain to keep Stegos compact. However, each privacy app must create an on-chain manifest which includes a description of the app, tags and keywords to aid searching, the URL used to download it and a hash of the app bundle.\nThe app bundles will be signed with the developers’ public key, which will allow users to leave on-chain app reviews to rank individual apps and developers.\n What are red packets? How will they work? Red packets (hongbao) are a way to send surprise gifts or payments to individuals and groups. Users will decide how many tokens they want to add to a red packet and how many random gifts they want to distribute. (This number can be set to 1 to make a one-off payment.)\nPrivate red packets can be sent to an individual or group via private Stegos chat or public red packets can be created to distribute a tokens among anyone who has access to the QR code.\nUsers who try to open a public red packet via the QR code will randomly receive one (or none) of the prizes inside. Users can keep trying to open the red packet until it is empty or expires.\nRed packets incorporate a necessary delay to prevent abuse. During this delay, it will be possible to display adverts or other promotional material.\n Is the Stegos App finished? The mobile app is still under development, but you can try the latest version of the desktop app by heading to https://github.com/stegos/stegos-wallet/releases/tag/v0.17\n I restored my wallet but my transaction history is gone! What should I do? This is normal. Stegos is private and confidential blockchain, therefore our blockchain doesn't store information about who has made any particular paymnent. Therefore, when you delete your wallet history, or migrate wallet to a new device, it is possible to restore only (1) your accounts balance; (2) history of incoming transfers. All outgoing payment history will be lost.\n"},{"uri":"/faqs/privacy_blockchain/","title":"Stegos Privacy Blockchain","tags":[],"description":"","content":"What is Stegos? The Stegos privacy platform provides users with fully private transactions, messaging and data transmission. Stegos acts as a gateway to an entire ecosystem of privacy services and apps. Stegos combines a unique blockchain and token design to implement the first cryptocurrency that’s absolutely private, secure, efficient and fully mobile compatible. The most up to date information can be found in the Project section of our website at http://stegos.com.\n How can I be sure that STG transactions are unlinkable, untraceable, and completely confidential? Stegos uses multiple methods to ensure maximum privacy. User identities are obfuscated using cryptographic key pairs, and each transaction uses a new stealth address. Transactions are combined into supertransactions to hide sender and receiver information, while all transaction amounts are hidden using cryptographic commitments (Pedersen commitments) and zero-knowledge range proofs (Bulletproofs). Validator stakes and transaction fees are the only exception since these must be visible for blockchain validation to work. However, users can create as many wallets as they choose, so validation and staking can be performed separately and privately.\n Who is building Stegos? The Stegos team doesn't just bring blockchain experience to the table (although we have plenty of that, too). With backgrounds in finance, aerospace, and cryptography, the team has a breadth of experience in applying technology to some of the most sensitive challenges facing society. Want to know more about the team? Check them out here: https://github.com/stegos/stegos/wiki/Whitepaper-EN#team\n How can Stegos send messages via the blockchain? Unlike other blockchains, Stegos is regularly pruned to keep it small. This means the Stegos blockchain has space for messages in addition to standard transactions.\n How can Stegos work on mobile? Stegos is optimized for use on mobile. The Stegos chain is compact, and we use a version of Proof-of-stake to secure it, which makes it viable to run full nodes on your phone and earn STG tokens from your pocket.\n Will there be an app? Yes, there will be a primary Stegos app which serves as a user-friendly gateway to the Stegos privacy ecosystem. See the Stegos App section below for more details and questions.in scale? Stegos is designed with users in mind and optimized for mobile. Therefore, it is essential for the blockchain to remain small and efficient. This is done using transactional sharding and block pruning: spent coins and expired data are safely and securely removed from the blockchain.\n What consensus mechanism does the Stegos privacy blockchain use? The Stegos privacy blockchain uses a version of Albatross which has been optimized for privacy and mobile compatibility. Stegos block rewards are distributed using gamified Proof-of-stake (gPoS), a unique modification to Proof-of-stake which ensures that all users have a fair chance to earn tokens for maintaining and validating the network, not just whales.\n How does gPoS work? In addition to regular staking, gPoS adds a validator sevice award, a randomly distributed award which will be distributed to a single user who has helped to maintain the Stegos blockchain in the most recent award cycle.\n How is the validator service award funded? One-third of the block reward from each newly created block is added to the award pool.\n How much is the validator service award? The validator service award grows with each block until it is randomly triggered to be distributed to a single eligible user. The current size of the validator service award will be displayed on the Stegos website and in the Stegos app.\n How often is the validator service award distributed? In order to keep the award exciting and to prevent manipulation, the award is distributed to a random user at a random time, with the likelihood of the award being released increasing as the award pool grows. On average, however, we expect the award to be allocated every few thousand blocks. This ensures that all active users have an extremely high chance of being selected to help validate the blockchain by the time the award is triggered.\n How can you guarantee that the validator service award is random? Many features of Stegos require randomness to work. This randomness is ensured via verifiably unbiased distributed randomness, ensuring that no-one can predict or manipulate the result.\n"},{"uri":"/faqs/privacy/","title":"Stegos Privacy Platform","tags":[],"description":"","content":"What is Stegos?

Out-of-band notifications from the server to a client.  Remote Procedure Calls Remote procedure calls are similar to JSON-RPC:\nSample request:\n{ \u0026#34;id\u0026#34;: 2, \u0026#34;type\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;balance_info\u0026#34; \u0026#34;account_id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;1\u0026#34;, } Sample response:\n{ \u0026#34;id\u0026#34;: 2, \u0026#34;account_id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;1\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;type\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;balance_info\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;payment\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;current\u0026#34;: 1000000, \u0026#34;available\u0026#34;: 1000000 }, \u0026#34;public_payment\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;current\u0026#34;: 0, \u0026#34;available\u0026#34;: 0 }, \u0026#34;stake\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;current\u0026#34;: 0, \u0026#34;available\u0026#34;: 0 }, \u0026#34;current\u0026#34;: 1000000, \u0026#34;available\u0026#34;: 1000000, \u0026#34;is_final\u0026#34;: false } The protocol supports multiplexing. Client library can send multiple requests at once on the same connection and receive responses back in any order. Please note, that responses are sent as soon as they are ready. Never rely on the order of responses and use id field for tracking! Optional field id can be used to map responses to requests. This field is opaque, i.e.your client library can generate some arbitrary id for each request and server will include provided value to a reply.\nField type is a discriminator of requests and responses as well as notifications (see below). A value of type in a request doesn't necessary matches the value of type field in a response. Some requests may return different types of responses. For example, any RPC request can end up with an error:\n{ \u0026#34;type\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;error\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;error\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Not enough money.\u0026#34; } Notifications Out-of-band notifications are sent by server to notify a client about some events, e.g.when block has been added or accounts's balance has changed:\n{ \u0026#34;type\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;balance_changed\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;account_id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;1\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;balance\u0026#34;: 999996010 } Notifications never have id field. For synchronous client library, you can filter out or notification based on type or presence of id fields.\n Wallet API Stegos Node provides API to manage accounts and sending transactions.\nOne Node has exactly one attached Wallet. One Wallet can hold multiple Accounts. One Account has exactly one primary Curve25519 keypair. Each Account is uniquely identified its Public Key.\nAccount's Public Key can be used to receive both private and public payments. There is no special need in temporary addreses like in Bitcoin, because our private payments implements Confidental Transactios and all recepient\u0026rsquo; addressese are always clocked.\nHowever, for the sake of Bitcoin compatibility, we also support Virtual Public Addresses. Virtual Public Address is like a regular public keys, but it can only be used for receiving public (uncloaked) payments. All PublicUTXO sent to such addresses will be deposited to the primary keypair and can be spent as usual by using cloak API CALL. All other kinds of UTXO sent to such virtual address will be permanently lost. Each Account can have zero or more such Virtual Public Addresses. You can use public addresses to implement Bitcoin-like behaviour. For example, exchanges can use virtual public addresses to receive deposits from customers. But please never use virtual public addresses for private payments. It makes no sense since private payments are always cloaked.\nUnder the hood virtual public addresses implemented as deterministic key pairs generated from the primary account key + sequential uint32 number, called public_address_id. The first key will have id=1, second- id=2 and so far. However, some numbers doesn't produce valid Curve25519 keys and should be ignored. Since all addresses are deterministically generated, there is no need in separate backup. Please remember the last used public_address_id and provide this value during recovery. Wallet will automatically re-create all public addreses up to public_address_id. This patch changes show recovery and recover account to support `public_address_id.\nAll public keys and addresses in API calls are encoded using bech32:\naccount_pkey = bech32_encode(prefix, curve25519_public_key) Where supported prefixes are:\n stg - MainNet stt - TestNet str - DevNet dev - tests  Wallet automatically assigns a short unique surrogate identifier to each keypair to use in API calls. This identifier is called by account_id. Please do not confuse with account_pkey which is an Account's Public Key.\nEach Account has associated password. This password is used as a seed for a key derivation function for AES-128 encryption. Encryption protects a secret key and other sensitive data. Since this password is never stored in any way, there are no possible technical ways to recover it from the node. This obviously doesn't protect from possible leaks via side-channels or via Rubber-hose cryptanalysis.\nEach Account can be recovered using 24-word Recovery Phrase. This recovery phrase is a mnemonic representation of raw account's secret key. Since this 24-word recovery phrase is just another representation of raw Curve25519 secret key, no password is needed to recover from it.\nAccounts have concept of Sealing/Unsealing:\n Sealed account doesn't store sensitive information in the memory, such as secret key, balance, history and other.Sealed account can't create transaction and spent your money. Since secret key is not loaded, Sealed account also doesn't receive notifications about incoming payments. Unsealed account has secret key loaded into the memory.Unsealed account can create transactions, receive notification about incoming payments and perform other actions. In order to unseal account, a password is needed. Currently account is not Sealed automatically by a timeout, but this feature may be added in the future.  List Accounts Returns a list of account.\nRequest:\n{ \u0026#34;type\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;list_accounts\u0026#34;, } Response:\n{ \u0026#34;type\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;accounts_info\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;accounts\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;1\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;account_pkey\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;dev1jjufnwk6u5scyj05259tpy2a7096dap0umj5uhqlynfdfua255fs5fm7w4\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;network_pkey\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;984f5b13828d4747f7442861c138eaa575d4875df29e37bfcd985c7ca27147475cabf32416cd7935f9c897a720ba6f039693765e72e0f6aadd92a9642fb61639a0370eef5e8ee3a0570e34a629515c98f56b0095b16825b50e602f70f34ca398\u0026#34; } } } Create Account Creates a new account.\nRequest:\n{ \u0026#34;type\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;create_account\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;password\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;plain-text-password\u0026#34; } Response:\n{ \u0026#34;type\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;account_created\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;account_id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;1\u0026#34; } Delete Account Request:\n{ \u0026#34;type\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;delete_account\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;account_id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;2\u0026#34; } Response:\n{ \u0026#34;type\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;account_deleted\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;account_id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;2\u0026#34; } Get Recovery Phrase Returns 24-word recovery phrase.\nUnsealed: yes\nRequest:\n{ \u0026#34;type\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;recovery_info\u0026#34; \u0026#34;account_id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;1\u0026#34;, } Response:\n{ \u0026#34;account_id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;1\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;type\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;recovery\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;recovery\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;swear praise ginger oxygen anchor ten small planet crime cave fold chuckle foot dragon decorate guess poverty grass crew depend define twice mother update\u0026#34; \u0026#34;last_public_address_id\u0026#34;: 4 }  last_public_address_id - ID of the last created public address.
