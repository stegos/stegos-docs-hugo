To celebrate our final testnet release before the upcoming Stegos IEO and mainnet release, we&amp;rsquo;re offering a $150,000 bounty program to help spread the word about Stegos and collect feedback on our app and blockchain.
The bounty program will run in two parts, each with a prize pool of $75,000 in STG coins. The two halves of the bounty program will run simultaneously, and you can take part in both.</description></item><item><title>Installing the Stegos Desktop Wallet</title><link>/bounty/installing_wallet/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/bounty/installing_wallet/</guid><description>Install the Stegos desktop wallet by visiting the latest release page:

You can download the CLI from here.

To stake, switch to the account registered with the bounty and type stake [amount].
