Stegos will generate a pre-mine of 1 billion STG tokens. Up to 51.25% of the STG pre-mine may be privately sold to high net-worth individuals and companies to reach a maximum of $30 million. Stegos has already raised $15 million of this target in 2018. Once the mainnet is launched, STG tokens will be sold directly to the general public using the built-in DEX.</description></item><item><title>Stegos App</title><link>/about/stegos_app/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/about/stegos_app/</guid><description>What features will the Stegos App have?

Stegos uses multiple methods to ensure maximum privacy. User identities are obfuscated using cryptographic key pairs, and each transaction uses a new stealth address. Transactions are combined into supertransactions to hide sender and receiver information, while all transaction amounts are hidden using cryptographic commitments (Pedersen commitments) and zero-knowledge range proofs (Bulletproofs). Validator stakes and transaction fees are the only exception since these must be visible for blockchain validation to work.</description></item><item><title>Stegos Privacy Platform</title><link>/about/privacy/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/about/privacy/</guid><description>What is Stegos?
