## FAQs

**How do I back up my public key?**

Choose the account you want to back up, then click "Account Settings" and then "Backup". You'll be shown your 24-word backup phrase. Record it somewhere safe and don't share it with anyone.

**I've lost my public key! What can I do?**

If you've backed up your wallet, you can restore it by using the "Restore" option. You'll be asked to enter your 24-word backup phrase and your public key will then be visible again. If you didn't back up your wallet, there's no way to recover access. Your tokens are permanently lost.
