## FAQs

**What operating systems are supported?**

There are versions of the wallet for MacOS, Windows, and all major Linux distributions

**Is there an Android or iOS wallet?**

Not at the moment. Our Android wallet is currently in development and will be released in Q1. You can see a first-look video of it here. There are currently no plans to release an iOS wallet, as it would be impossible to distribute it widely due to Apple's restrictions on private apps.

**I have a 32-bit system, can I install the wallet?**

No. Unfortunately, the wallet is only available for 64-bit builds.
