#### How is Stegos being funded?
Stegos generated a pre-mine of 1 billion STG tokens, of which around 50% was privately sold to high net-worth individuals and companies. Stegos raised $15 million in 2018, which has been used to develop and market the Stegos blockchain and desktop and mobile apps. Once the mobile app is launched, Stegos will begin to transition to a more decentralized governance structure.

Development has been on-going for over a year. The Stegos desktop wallet launched in August 2019, the Stegos mainnet launched in Nov 2019 and the Stegos mobile wallet and node will launch in Q1 2020.
