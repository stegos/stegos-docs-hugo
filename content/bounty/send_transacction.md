To send a transaction, simply enter the Stegos wallet app and choose "Send" from the menu on the left-hand side.

Choose the account you want to send STG from, and then fill in the other fields.

If you want to verify this transaction later, make sure you check the "Generate Payment Certificate" box. You'll need to do this to complete the bounty task.

Click next.

Double check that all the details are correct, then click send. Your transaction should process almost instantly, and your balance will be updated.
