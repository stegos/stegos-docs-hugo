#### How can Stegos send messages and data via the blockchain?
Unlike other blockchains, Stegos is regularly pruned to keep it small. This means the Stegos blockchain has space for messages and data, in addition to standard transactions.

#### How can Stegos work on mobile?
Stegos is optimized for use on mobile. The Stegos chain is compact, and we use a version of Proof-of-stake to secure it, which makes it viable to run full nodes on your phone and earn STG tokens from your pocket.
