#### How is Stegos being funded?
Stegos will generate a pre-mine of 1 billion STG tokens. Up to 51.25% of the STG pre-mine may be privately sold to high net-worth individuals and companies to reach a maximum of $30 million. Stegos has already raised $15 million of this target in 2018. Once the mainnet is launched, STG tokens will be sold directly to the general public using the built-in DEX.

#### Has development started?
Development has been on-going for many months. The testnet launched has already launched, and mainnet is due to launch on May 31st.
___
#### When does the mainnet launch?
Mainnet will launch on May 31st
___
#### What features will be available at mainnet launch?
Most features will be implemented at launch, although full mobile support will come later. The app will not be available at launch, so there will be no UI available for non-payment transactions such as messages. However, transaction pruning will be implemented at launch, so it will still be possible to use these features manually.
