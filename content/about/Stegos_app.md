#### Where can I find other Stegos privacy apps?
In addition to the main Stegos app, the Stegos privacy ecosystem is designed to encourage the development of other apps which focus on privacy and use the Stegos platform as a base. To help users find Stegos will have an on-chain privacy app store.
___
#### How will the app store work? How will I know apps are safe and private?
Stegos privacy apps will be stored off-chain to keep Stegos compact. However, each privacy app must create an on-chain manifest which includes a description of the app, tags and keywords to aid searching, the URL used to download it and a hash of the app bundle.

The app bundles are signed with the developersâ€™ public key, which allows users to leave on-chain app reviews to rank individual apps and developers.
___
#### What are red packets? How do they work?
Red packets (hongbao) are a way to send surprise gifts or payments to individuals and groups. Users decide how many tokens they want to add to a red packet and how many random gifts they want to distribute. (This number can be set to 1 to make a one-off payment.)

Private red packets can be sent to an individual or group via private Stegos chat or public red packets can be created to distribute a tokens among anyone who has access to the QR code.

Users who try to open a public red packet via the QR code will randomly receive one (or none) of the prizes inside. Users can keep trying to open the red packet (with a slight delay) until it is empty or expires.
