Stegos is a fully private blockchain that provides users with a simple, secure and most importantly complete approach to their online communications and transactions. Other privacy coins focus solely on providing untraceable transactions, but this is just one part of the equation: users need to be able to communicate privately before making these transactions, or they will leak metadata which governments and other malicious actors can use to identify them.

To address this concern, Stegos provides fully private one-to-one and group messaging in addition to standard payment transactions.
