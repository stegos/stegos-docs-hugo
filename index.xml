Exchange services usually handle a large number of users. For security reasons, they store secret keys in a secure place, often without access to the internet. Thus the standard Stegos approach is incompatible with standard exchange processes.
To get around this problem, for exchanges we make use of Public outputs.</description></item><item><title>Funding and Development</title><link>/faqs/funding_and_development/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/faqs/funding_and_development/</guid><description>How is Stegos being funded?
